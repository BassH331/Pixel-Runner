# Guardian Runner ⚔️🔥

**Guardian Runner** is an epic 2D endless runner set in the mystical realm of **Aethelgard**. You are the last of the **Star-Fire Guardians**, sworn to protect the light against a creeping Shadow Curse. Armed with the legendary **Fire Sword**, you must dash through a pixelated world, battling the encroaching darkness to save your home from eternal night.

## 📜 The Story

In the heart of Aethelgard, the **Star-Fire** once balanced light and shadow, bringing prosperity to the land. But a malevolent force has cast a **Shadow Curse**, threatening to extinguish the flame forever.

Ancient prophecies spoke of a hero—a Guardian who would wield the lost Fire Sword and run against the dying light. That hero is **YOU**.

Guided by the whispers of a forgotten wizard, you have reclaimed the blade that sings with the Star-Fire's hymn. Now, your trial begins. You must run, jump, and fight through the cursed lands, dodging corrupted creatures.

**Will you purge the shadows, or will Aethelgard fall into darkness? Your destiny awaits!**
