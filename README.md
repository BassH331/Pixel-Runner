# Guardian Runner ⚔️🔥 - Aethelgard's Last Hope

**Guardian Runner** is an epic 2D endless runner set in the mystical realm of **Aethelgard**. As the last of the **Star-Fire Guardians**, you are sworn to protect the light against a creeping Shadow Curse. Armed with the legendary **Fire Sword**, your destiny is to dash through a pixelated world, battling the encroaching darkness to save your home from eternal night.

## 📜 The Prophecy & Your Quest

The ancient prophecies of Aethelgard foretold a time when the delicate balance between light and shadow would shatter. A malevolent **Shadow Curse** has descended upon the land, threatening to extinguish the eternal **Star-Fire** and plunge all into unending darkness.

You are the hero whispered about in legends—the Guardian destined to wield the lost **Fire Sword**, a blade imbued with the Star-Fire's essence. Guided by the ethereal whispers of a forgotten wizard, you have reclaimed this legendary weapon. Now, your trial begins.

Run, jump, and fight through treacherous, cursed lands, dodging corrupted creatures and fiery obstacles. Each step brings you closer to either salvation or oblivion.

**Will you fulfill the prophecy and purge the shadows, or will Aethelgard fall into eternal darkness? The fate of your world rests solely on your blade and your speed!**
